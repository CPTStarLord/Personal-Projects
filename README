//The user selects a file and clicks the upload button.
//The React app creates a FormData object with the file.
//A POST request is sent to the server.
//The server receives the file:

//If successful, it saves the file and returns a success response.
//If there's an error, it returns an error response.


//The React app displays a success or error message accordingly.

//To integrate this backend with the React frontend we created earlier:

//Install necessary packages: npm install express multer cors
//Create a new file (e.g., server.js) and paste the Node.js code into it.
//Run the server with node server.js
//Update the fetch URL in the React component to http://localhost:3001/upload

//This setup provides a complete file upload solution with a React frontend and Node.js backend. The graph helps visualize the process flow, making it easier to understand how the components interact.
